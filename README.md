## Data Viz Project Repository

*Please see the project at https://besanson.shinyapps.io/DataViz_Final_Project/

This repository has the following files and folders:

+ `ScrapingTweets.R`: this script has the work done downloading the tweets for the different tasks of the project
+ `Merge.R`: this script merge the different output of `ScrapingTweets.R` into two datasets: `dataset1.csv` and `dataset2.csv`. The first one is used for the first task (data analysis) and the second one for the second task (sentiment analysis).
+ `DataAnalysis.R`: this script has all the work done for the first task, from facts to plots.
+ `SentAnalysis.R`: this script has all the work done for the second task, from facts to plots.
+ `PlotCrash.R`: this script has the plot that shows the crash
+ Data: this folder has all the `csv files` generated in the project but `dataset1.csv` and `dataset2.csv` (because these two exceeded GITHUB limit).
+ Dictionary: this folder has the dictionaries of positive and negative words from http://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html
+ DASHBOARD: this folder has the shiny app that was deployed later as https://besanson.shinyapps.io/DataViz_Final_Project/
